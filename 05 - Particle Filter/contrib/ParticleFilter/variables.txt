The following variables are stored in the Matlab data file:
- initial_state: the initial state of the vehicle as [x, y]
- numT: the number of time steps
- measurements: 
  o the position measurements of the vehicle
  o dimensions: [numT x 2] matrix
  o format for each row: [x y]
  o note: there is no measurement available for the initial_state
- delta_motion: 
   o the absolute (no velocities) motion delta of the vehicle
     for one discrete time step
   o dimensions: [numT x 2] matrix
   o format for each row: [delta_x delta_y]
   o note: the first row represents the delta motion from time step
           0 to time step 1
- true_poses:
  o the ground-truth vehicle poses
  o dimensions: [numT x 2] matrix
  o format for each row: [true_x true_y]
  o note: this is only used for evaluation of the filter
- noise_system:
  o the covariance matrix of the system noise, i.e. the vehicle motion
  o dimensions: [2 x 2] matrix
- noise_measurements:
  o the covariance matrix of the measurement noise, i.e. the position
    measurement
  o dimensions: [2 x 2] matrix
